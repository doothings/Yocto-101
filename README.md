Yocto-101
=========


Yocto 101 is a getting started guide to  the yocto project. This takes a step by step approach towards
configuring and building your own distros using the Yocto Project by the Linux foundation and in the process hone my skills.

To start with this you do not need any particular expertise, just a basic understanding of the Linux system and its components
is enough also you should be able to decipher scripts at a very abstract level (no in depth analysis necessary).

The corresponding blog posts are available at my blog

This project is still in native tage, so appologies for the unorganized content.
